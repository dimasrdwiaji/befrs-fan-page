THE ORIGINAL BLACK’S BARBECUE \nSOCIAL: @blacksbbq\nWEBSITE: https://www.blacksbbq.com/\nADDRESS: 215 North Main Street, Lockhart, Texas 78644\nOPERATION HOURS: Sun - Thurs 10AM - 8PM | Fri - Sat 10AM - 8:30PM\n\nThe Original Black’s Barbecue is the oldest in Texas, run by the same family since 1932. 3rd Generation Pitmaster Kent Black slow smokes all Barbecue the way his grandfather did in 1932. A simple rub, local Post Oak Wood and patience is the secret. Their brisket is truly legendary. \n\n🤤 HOMEMADE SAUSAGE: Black’s BBQ’s 80 year old recipe and techniques remain the same as each ring is hand stuffed and hand tied, then smoked to perfection. Take the brisket trimmings and chop them up, then place them in a mixer. Along with the chopped meat, add the mixture (salt, pepper, and a flour based binder) and water. Fine grind it so it comes out looking almost like hamburger meat. Pour into the stuffer. Stuff the casings with ground meat. Cut and tie them. Place in the smoker and allow them to smoke for about an hour. \n\n💸PRICE: $3.99 per ring\n\n🥩 BRISKET: Take raw brisket and trim off the fat. Begin by cutting some of the lean end off (this meat is used for sausage). Trim off the edges to make it round and make it more aerodynamic, which helps give the brisket less chance to burn. Cut off 2/3 of the hard fat. Continue trimming. Add Blacks secret seasoning, which includes special salt and pepper, red pepper, cayenne and secrets, and massage into the fibers of the meat. Place the raw brisket in the smoker and allow it to smoke for 6 hours. After the first cook, let the meat rest by removing the brisket and placing it in a walk-in cooler to dry-age for a few days. After dry-aging, it’s time for the second cook. Place the brisket back in the smoker for another roughly 6 hours, until your brisket is mouth-wateringly perfect. Don’t forget to enjoy it with Black’s infamous Norma Jean’s Original BBQ Sauce! \n\n💸PRICE: $22.99 per pound\n\n#BestEverUSATour #BestEverFoodReviewShow #BEFRS\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n \n💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION:\nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

Spread it flat onto wax paper. \n \n🥓 BACON WEAVE: Use house-made brown sugar. Take sliced bacon and weave it to make a bacon weave sheet. Place in a cooking pan. Place in the oven for 10 min. This is the layer between turkey & goose. \n \n🇻🇳 STUFFING: Chop celery, white onions & french baguettes into strips, then squares. Chop and add herbs (rosemary, sage & parsley). Add dried cranberries, quail eggs, salt, pepper, milk, pork fat and mix it all together. Add a few more dried cranberries on top. Place wax paper on top and press it down with a rolling pin. This is the layer between chicken & duck. \n \n🌿 HERB GREMOLATA: Use lemon zest, lemon skin, rosemary, parsley, sage, chopped shallots, chopped garlic and pour in olive oil. Add salt and pepper and mix. This will be the layer between the duck & quail. \n \n🇻🇳 BBQ LEATHER: Begin with Quan Ut Ut’s Carolina gold bbq sauce.

MAASAI HOMESTEAD (Manyatta): Cow’s Blood with Milk + Porridge \nADDRESS: Kimana Sanctuary, Amboseli \nOPEN: N/A\n\nBack in the Maasai Homestead. We spent some time with the tribe and participated in a ritual that is both sacred and ordinary to the Maasai people. For decades, drinking cow’s blood was a way to make the most of cattle. They do not wish to slaughter an animal each week for meat so, in order to get nutrients such as iron and protein, they take some blood from the cow without killing it. This practice typically happens twice a month and on different cows in a herd. \n\n🇰🇪 COW’S BLOOD WITH MILK: The blood is taken from the cow and then stirred rapidly to separate the coagulation. Fresh milk is also added to prevent clotting. It is then poured into cups and served as a complete meal. \n\n🇰🇪 PORRIDGE: The milk is also used to make porridge. The flour is mixed with milk in bowl. Some water is brought to a boil in a sufuria and the mixture is added while stirring continuously as it boils. \n\n💸PRICE: N/A\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

We we watched how the men of the tribe sometimes prepare and roast a whole goat. This usually occurs when the Maasai men spend the night out in the plains after roaming far from home to graze the livestock. Per tradition, they don’t eat in front of women. They however take back certain pieces for the women, once they are done feasting. This bonding time with the Maasai men is said to build fraternity. \n\n🇰🇪 RAW BLOOD AND KIDNEY: The goat is slaughtered and the blood is collected in a sufuria. This is drank fresh. Cuts like the kidney are also eaten raw. \n\n🇰🇪 GOAT ROAST: The legs are skewered on makeshift spears, and are roasted upright around a central fire. Once ready, this will be cut in front of everyone and passed around the circle.\n\n🇰🇪 BLOOD SOUP: The soup is made using herbs to cleanse the system. The intestines are boiled then fried in their own fat, and is then served. The liver is also roasted medium-rare and passed around in the circle until it is gone. \n\n💸PRICE: N/A\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

Zebus are the most prized livestock in Madagascar, brought to the island 1,000 years ago from east Africa. As part of the zebu ritual, the entire village comes together, give thanks to the zebu before sacrificing it and feeding 100+ people.

It was built between 1926 and 1936 by the French colonial administration as an effort to open the east coast and create a means of transporting agricultural products. \n\nToday, the train acts as a lifeline for local communities that aren’t accessible by road. A lack of upkeep since the 1960s has resulted in the train regularly breaking down, causing delays and even de-railings. Patient travelers looking for an opportunity to see arguably the most scenic parts of Madagascar as well as local life at each stop along the way will find this 12-24++ (yes, you read that right) hour journey unlike anything they’ve experienced before. Plus, you can sample local flavors at each stop.\n\n💸TRAIN PRICE: 4.54 USD/16,000 MGA for 2nd class | 11.35 USD/40,000 MGA for 1st class\n\n» THE TRAIN FOOD\n\n1. FIANARANTSOA TRAIN STOP: Rice Porridge with Zebu Meatballs\nADDRESS: Fianarantsoa, Madagascar\n\n🥣Zebu meatballs are added to rice porridge, which is made with ginger, garlic and green leaves. And a bit of oil.\n----\n2. STOP 1: Fried Potatoes with Gravy + Nem \n\n🥔FRIED POTATO: Fried potatoes with a side of country gravy for dipping.\n\nNEM: Nem is similar to a fried spring roll. \n\n💸PRICE: 1.42 USD/5,000 MGA for a mix of fried potato and nem \n----\n3. SAHAMBAVY TRAIN STOP: Yogurt + Crocodile Bullets\nADDRESS: Sahambavy, Madagascar\n\n🐊CROCODILE BULLETS: Grated cassava root, shaped and fried until golden crispy.  \n----\n4. TSIMANAVAKA: Stuffed Fried Chilis + Zebu + Shrimp + Freshwater Eel\nADDRESS: Sahambavy, Madagascar\n\nTsimanavaka is a restaurant located right across the street from the Sahambavy stations. We sampled their stuffed fried chilis, zebu, shrimp and freshwater eel. \n\n🌶STUFFED FRIED CHILIS: Green chili stuffed with zebu meat and onion before being fried.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION:\nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

TSENA’NY TANTSAHA TALATAMATY: Rice Porridge + Chinese Noodle Soup\nADDRESS: Talatamaty City  \nOPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) \n\nFour miles outside of Madagascar’s capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country’s largest local morning markets, Tsena’ny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. \n\n🥣RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. \n\n🥡CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. \n----\n2. TALATA VOLON’ONDRY: Sausage + Koba\nADDRESS: Talata Volon’ondry \nOPEN: Varies \n\nTalata Volon’ondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar’s national snack, koba. \n\n🥔SAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. \n\n🇲🇬KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. \n\nKoba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.\n💸PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION:\nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN’s 2011 list of the World’s 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan. \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/InstaSonnySide\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

These yummy little dehydrated yogurt balls come in an assortment of flavors including basil and chili flavored. Most of the stalls are family run, passed down generation by generation. \n\n💸PRICE: 5 USD per kg/41,610 UZS per kg \n----\n2. SAZANCHIK: Mutton Meat\nADDRESS: Chimgan Mountain of Tashkent \nOPEN: April - September | 8AM - 1AM \n\nSazanchik boasts traditional nomadic food, which guests eat in one of their yurts to get a glimpse of nomadic life in the mountains of Uzbekistan. This restaurant is known for their incredible mountain lamb, considered the wagyu of lamb in Uzbekistan. Due to adapting to the extreme weather and living conditions, the mountain lambs in Tashkent have less fat than typical lambs. \n\n🏔UZBEK MOUNTAIN LAMB: Prepare the lamb using mountain herbs and lemon before wrapping it and allowing it to marinate overnight (12 hours). After fully marinating, place the lamb over a fire to roast for 6-7 hours, until the meat is fully cooked and the skin nice and crispy.  \n\n💸PRICE: 350 USD/2,911,168 UZS for whole sheep | 18 USD/149,717 UZS per kg \n----\n3. SAZANCHIK: Beshbarmak (Flat Noodles + Horse Sausage) \nADDRESS: Chimgan Mountain of Tashkent \nOPEN: April - September | 8AM - 1AM \n\nBeshbarmak means “five fingers,” and refers to the fact that this traditional nomadic dish is meant to be eaten using your hands. The woman preparing this dish for us for us has been making besh barmaq for 30 years. While the dish itself is tasty, it also serves a very practical purpose: the flat noodles fill you up and keep you full for long time while the horse meat keeps you warm in the cold mountain weather. \n\n🖐BESHBARMAK: Mixing chicken eggs, salt and flour, create the dough for the noodles. Knead the dough and then roll it with the largest rolling pin you can find. Cut into square pieces. Boil the flat square noodles in horse stock and place them on a large round dish. The sauce contains horse fat extract, dried potatoes, onion and horse stock. Finally, pour the sauce over the noodles and then pile on horse meat, horse intestine and horse sausage.\n\n💸PRICE: 4 USD/33,281 UZS\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/InstaSonnySide\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

The pandan leaves add a nice fragrance to the bugs while cutting the bitter taste. She adds her first round of bugs and allows them to fry for roughly 30 minutes. She allows the crickets to cook for only 15 minutes. To enhance the flavors, she does not clean the pan between bugs.

Add the boiled dal and cook.  \n\nTo make the baati, combine wheat flour, salt and water and knead into tennis ball-sized dough balls.

CHAUDHARY NAMKEEN: Mirchi Vada \nADDRESS: 119-120, 2nd B Road, Sardarpura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan 342003\nOPEN: 11AM - 8PM\n\nMirchi vada, a popular Rajasthani snack or breakfast, are green chilies filled with spicy potatoes, dipped in batter and fried. We went to Chaudhary Namkeen, a family-owned restaurant that has been serving mirchi vada using their secret masala recipe for four generations. \n\n🌶MAKE MIRCHI VADA: Boil potatoes, cool and mash them. Chaudhary Namkeen then adds their secret masala (using ingredients such as dry lemon powder, chilli powder, asafoetida, turmeric and salt) into the mashed potatoes. Grind the lentil and, using water, salt and red chili powder, create the batter. Cut a slit down the center of the chillies, add the mashed potato mixture and coat with freshly ground gram flour batter, allowing them to cook from the inside. Fry. Eat. To cut the saltiness and spice, many people eat mirchi vada with bread. \n\nPRICE: 25 cents/17Rs per piece\n__\n\n2. GYPSY RESTAURANT: Gulab Jamun Ki Sabzi\nADDRESS: 689, 9th C Rd, Sardarpura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan 342003\nOPEN: 12PM - 1:45PM, 7PM - 10:30PM\n\nJodhpur is the highest consumer of ghee (clarified butter) in India. Rather than a typical onion/tomato-based curry, Jodhpur is known for using dairy products. Gulab jamun are a milk-solid-based sweet, typically eaten as a dessert; however, in Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they cook them in a gravy made from nuts and tomato to create gulab jamun ki sabzi.\n\n🤤MAKE GULAB JAMUN KI SABZI: Combine refined flour, mawa (milk solid) and cumin seeds and roll them into balls. Fry the rolled balls in ghee, then soak them in water for roughly 15 min, until they become soggy. In a wok, add ghee, cumin seeds, hung curd, dessicated coconut, turmeric, garam masala, salt, red chilli powder, mawa and cook.\n\nPRICE: $5/367Rs for thali buffet platter of 31 items; $10-12/800-900Rs per kg, if only gulab jamun ki sabzi\n__\n\n3. SHASTRI CIRCLE MARKET: Shastri Circle Market is an ideal spot to take a break and sample a variety of local foods after a long day of exploring Jodhpur. We tried pani puri and a special chaat. \nOPEN: 5PM - 9PM\n\nPANI PURI\n\nPani puri is a wheat puffed crisp filled with a mixture of boiled potatoes, boiled black channa (pulse), salt and red chilli powder. Top off this tasty snack by filling it with flavored water and enjoy! \n\nPRICE: 27 cents/20Rs per plate (8 pieces)\n \nTHE GIRLFRIEND CHAAT\n\nChaat is a savory snack typically served at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts. The stall where we stopped offers a unique Girlfriend Chaat, known for its intense spice. True love is is put to the test by challenging your partner to eat this insanely spicy snack. It’s a mean test, trust me. \n\n🔥MAKE THE GIRLFRIEND CHAAT: Starting with baked wheat cups, add green chillies, Kashmiri red chilli powder, Rajasthani red chilli powder, black salt, chaat masala, garam masala, gram flour shavings, tamarind chutney, gram flour fried balls of different colors, pressed fried chickpeas, tomato and coriander. Eat and prepare for the heat. \n\nPRICE: 40 cents/30Rs per piece \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n💬COME SAY HI:\nINSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/InstaSonnySide\nFACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook\n\n🤝SUPPORT OUR MISSION: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

Cover it with a wet jute sack so that it doesn’t burn as it needs to be in direct contact with the fire for 2 hours in the pit.\n\n2) Junglee Mass (Wild meat)\nFive Ingredients Recipe-\nIf hunting, you get stranded, these are easily available in any village\nRed chilli powder, Ghee, Salt, Dal or lentil, Coriander seeds, Lamb pieces. In a wok, combine everything together till the meat is soft and tender.\n\nCome say hi on:\nINSTAGRAM → https://www.instagram.com/instasonnyside/\nFACEBOOK → https://www.facebook.com/BestEverFoodReviewShow/\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSupport My Channel: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

This beautiful province is the perfect respite for relaxing or for what we came here for, which is to get drunk off the local bahalina, which is made from tuba. Tuba is the sap which comes form the coconut tree. Did you know coconut trees could get you drunk? \n\nAfter learning all about bahalina, it was time to grab a few villagers from around town and play some beer pong. Grab your balls (ping pong balls) and get ready to play. \n\nCheck out Bahal Max next time you're in Argao.

New video every Wednesday! \n\nAbout This Episode:\nI really shouldn't make videos like this. Here's why.\n\nIt's not because of the content. Actually, this is one of my favorite videos so far.\n\nI'm often torn between video topics that are compelling to me and...the dark side of travel videos, topics that will rank on Google.\nSmart bloggers/vloggers aim their content at what people are searching for. I mean, Mark Wiens from Migrationolgy comes to Saigon for two weeks and suddenly he pops up on Google for all the most popular foods here. The dude hits the most popular stalls and restaurants in each city, because that's what people are searching for. Much respect to the guy. He's a freaking god when it comes to SEO.\n\nWhat that means for me though, is that this video isn't gonna get many views, because no one is searching \"Cambodia Villager Beer Shotgun\" on Google or Youtube. Can you see why I'm torn?\n\nI love this video because it has great story-telling elements. It's entertaining and silly while still revealing some interesting tidbits about the way people in Cambodia live.\n\nIn the end, I'm gonna go with my gut when choosing vid topics and sometimes my gut will want to shotgun beers with the locals.\n\nCome say hi on:\nINSTAGRAM → https://www.instagram.com/instasonnyside/\nFACEBOOK → https://www.facebook.com/SonnySideFilmsFan/\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSupport My Channel: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

New video every Wednesday! \n\nAbout This Episode:\nBook your Food Tour with Angkor Street Eats → http://angkorstreeteats.com/\n\nWhile in Siem Reap I went on an epic food tour with Angkor Street Eats, led by local guide, Kun. Throughout the duration of the evening I tried dozens of new foods and drinks that completely exceeded my expectations. \n\nThe tour provides a bevy of unique, authentically khmer dishes as well as a few adventure eating courses that will really test your palette. These are foods and places that you will not find on your own near any tourist areas. \n\nBeyond the amazing food, my guide Kun, was a beacon of knowledge. Since he grew up in Siem Reap, he is literally a part of its history. He told stories about conflicts within the country, the ways Siem Reap has changed over the years and of course, all about the food. \n\nI would highly recommend this tour to anyone going to Siem Reap. You will not find an experience like this anywhere else.  \n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThis video doesn't show all the locations we went to or all the food. I chose to highlight some of the more odd foods along the tour.\n\nCome say hi on:\nINSTAGRAM → https://www.instagram.com/instasonnyside/\nFACEBOOK → https://www.facebook.com/SonnySideFilmsFan/\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSupport My Channel: \nPatreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

That's why I'm fatter here. \n\nI hesitated to put it out, because of sound and light exposure issues. I knew there was an interesting story here, so I've put it out anyways. \n\nThis was an awesome and epic journey. We went deep into the Mekong Delta. This is as country as you get in Vietnam. Our guide was awesome. He showed us around and answered all our questions. \n\nTo be honest, this wasn't a difficult food for me. Rat is just another furry mammal and I knew they came from a clean source and obviously a pro was cooking them up. \n\nIf you're reading this, thanks yo!

New video every Wednesday! \n\nAbout This Episode:\nIn 2007, Andrew Zimmern of the Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods went to Dai's House Of Stink in Taiwan, a restaurant selling some of the most intense stinky tofu in all of Taipei. In this episode, a rare occurrence took place. Andrew was defeated by two menu items. \n\nTen years after watching this episode, from a series that inspired me to move to Asia in the first place, I find myself in the very same restaurant, anxious to find out just how challenging this dish is. \n\nPrior to filming this video, I went into Dai's House Of Stink to ask for shooting permission. The aroma lingering in the air nearly floored me. This place was no joke. The night before shooting, I could hardly sleep. What if I literally can't control it and my gag reflex kicks in causing me to embarrass myself and forcing me to retire my name as the best ever food reviewer. \n\nWell that didn't happen and my title remains. Check out the video to see it all unfold. \n\nAlso, big ups to Andrew. This is obvious just some good spirited fun. I think Andrew is the man and he's been making awesome content for years. \n\nAbout Sonny Side:\nI’m not sponsored. I’m not rich. I’m just some guy who wanted to make the type of travel videos that I would want to see.

Click the BELL icon to get updated as soon as a video is uploaded. New video every Wednesday! \n\nAbout This Episode:\nTraveling throughout Cambodia was a mixed bag. The police took my drone, but they couldn't break my spirit. They may not want you to see the best goddamn food videos ever from Cambodia, but that's not up to them. \n\nThe tourist areas of Cambodia are intense, over-stimulating and chaotic. Tuk tuk drivers constantly asking if you want a ride, or a girl, or drugs. It quickly becomes headache inducing. \n\nMy trip with Dani to this local market, just outside of Siem Reap was the perfect remedy for that. No foreigners and therefore no aggressive salespeople. Just locals going about their day, grabbing some food. \n\nIn this episode I try out some Cambodian pizza, noum krouk, red ants and finally we get the ingredients needed to cook up some prahok including the ill-named Cambodian cheese. \n\nAbout Sonny Side:\nI’m not sponsored. I’m not rich. I’m just some guy who wanted to make the type of travel videos that I would want to see.

I sample some snails (ốc), fried corn (Bắp Xào), a coconut ice-cream confection (Kem Xôi Dừa) and the Vietnamese classic, Banh Mi (Banh mì).

Me actually. \n\nOn this episode, I'm also joined by Vi of OneTrip Adventures. She's an authentic Vietnamese person so this should be no problem for her, right?

First I try out a longtime mystery food, duck tongue. Was it like making out with a duck? Yeah, kinda, but then also know cause of how I ate it and that's not something I do with a person I'm making out with for example. Also, small sausage in a large sausage. This was invented in Taiwan and it's amazing. Really, Edison can chill out with his inventions cause nothing he invented tasted even close to this good. What a joke. Get one.
